Kathy has been interested in learning theory
since her days as a game designer (she wrote
games for Virgin, MGM, and Amblin’). She
developed much of the Head First format while
teaching New Media Authoring for UCLA
Extension’s Entertainment Studies program.
More recently, she’s been a master trainer for Sun
Microsystems, teaching Sun’s Java instructors how
to teach the latest Java technologies, and a lead
developer of several of Sun’s Java programmer
and developer certification exams. Together
with Bert Bates, she has been actively using the
concepts in Head First Java to teach hundreds of
trainers, developers and even non-programmers.
She is also the founder of one of the largest Java
community websites in the world, javaranch.com,
and the Creating Passionate Users blog.
Along with this book, Kathy co-authored Head
First Servlets, Head First EJB, and Head First
Design Patterns.
In her spare time she enjoys her new Icelandic
horse, skiing, running, and the speed of light.

Bert is a software developer and architect, but a
decade-long stint in artificial intelligence drove
his interest in learning theory and technologybased training. He’s been teaching programming
to clients ever since. Recently, he’s been a
member of the development team for several of
Sun’s Java Certification exams.
He spent the first decade of his software career
travelling the world to help broadcast clients like
Radio New Zealand, the Weather Channel, and
the Arts & Entertainment Network (A & E). One
of his all-time favorite projects was building a full
rail system simulation for Union Pacific Railroad.
Bert is a hopelessly addicted Go player, and has
been working on a Go program for way too long.
He’s a fair guitar player, now trying his hand at
banjo, and likes to spend time skiing, running,
and trying to train (or learn from) his Icelandic
horse Andi.
Bert co-authored the same books as Kathy, and is
hard at work on the next batch of books (check
the blog for updates).
You can sometimes catch him on the IGS Go
server (under the login jackStraw).
